alttab is X11 window switcher designed for minimalistic window managers
or standalone X11 session.

  alttab  [-w N] [-d N] [-sc N] [-mk <str>] [-kk <str>] [-bk <str>]
  [-pk <str>] [-nk <str>] [-ck <str>] [-dk <str>] [-mm <N>] [-bm <N>]
  [-t NxM] [-i NxM] [-vp str] [-p str] [-s N] [-theme name] [-bg color]
  [-fg color] [-frame color] [-inact color] [-bc color] [-bw N]
  [-font name] [-vertical] [-e] [-b N] [-v|-vv]

(see man page for details)

Unlike task switchers integrated in most simple window managers (WM) or
dmenu-like switchers, alttab features visual interface and convenient
tactile behaviour: press modifier (Alt) - multiple switch with
a key (Tab) - release modifier.
Also, it's lightweight and depends only on basic X11 libs, conforming
to the usage of lightweight WM.

Usage
-----

Usually it should run fully functional without any argument.
Start alttab after WM, to let it automatically recognize the WM. 
For example, add the following to ~/.ratpoisonrc:

  exec alttab

For details about window manager configuration, see doc/wm-setup.md.
For usage on mobile devices, see [doc/mobile.md](doc/mobile.md).
If there are no WM at all, then start alttab in ~/.xsession or elsewhere.
